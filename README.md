# Adopt-A-Parrot

## Description
The goal of this project was to design a website for a fictional company that houses and adopts out parrots.  This project enabled me to practice with HTML, and CSS.  It also allowed me to practice user interface design, ensuring that code meets accessibility requirements, and making a website responsive.
